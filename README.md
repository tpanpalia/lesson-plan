This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Clone or Download ZIP. Extract and open in Visual Studio Code and run `npm install` and `npm start`.
1. On lesson button click, the ojectives for the lesson are diplayed.
2. Clicking on each objective displays video link, thumbnail.
3. Click on buttons (Done, NotDoing, NextClass) changes the state (border color of objectives) of the objective.
4. The state (background color) of the lesson changes to green when all the objectives are `Done`. Current lesson will have white background color and the default will be orange.
5. On clicking the thumbnail, video plays.
6. `View Activity` and `View Classflow` diplays the activities and classflow for each objective (on selecting objective) in a modal.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Run `npm install` to install dependencies in the local node_modules folder.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
